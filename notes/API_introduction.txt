1. API stands for Application Programming Interface
2. It is a medium to communicate among different entities. (FE-BE, BE-BE, Mobile-BE)
3. The communication medium is JSON (Javascript Object Notation)

There are two types of API calls
1. SOAP API
2. REST API


=> In SOAP APIs communication is done in XML format
<student>
    <first_name>Jon</first_name>
    <last_name>fghjk</last_name>
</student>


=> We use /make REST API in this course
=> REST stands for Representational State Transfer
=> Here we communicate in JSON
{
    "student":{
        "first_name": "JON",
        "last_name": "dfgh"
    }
}


Q. Why to use DRF (Django Rest Framework) if we can make APIs using Django itself?
    => There are lots of packages already created in DRF for APIs which are not present in Django.
1. Serializer
    ->DRF provides serialization / deserialization feature not included in Django
2. API Authentication and Permission
3. PAGINATION and Filter Backend for API
4. Throttling
