There are three model relations
1. One-One
2. One-Many
3. Many-Many


1. One-Many relation
=> Iy is generally used for the case when we need to group items under certian category
=> E.g. Classroom=>Student, FoodCategory=>Food, JobCategory=>Jobs, District=>Municipalities,
        Team=>Players

class Category:
    name = models.CharField()


class Food:
    name = models.CharField()
    price = models.FloatField()
    category = models.ForeignKey(Food)


2. One-One Relation
=> One-one relation is useful when we need to map a single row of one table with a row
of another table
=> E.g. User=>UserProfile, BankLocker=>Customer
