=> Reinventing the wheels. Do not reinvent the wheel.
=> Certain tasks are already dine in the frameworks. That makes our work easier

3. Famous Python web frameworks
=> Django
=> Flask 
=> FastAPI
=> Pyramid

- Using flask most of the tasks are in the developers hand. We need to explicitly install different tools from the open source to complete a project
- Django is a full-fledge framework. For most of the tasks, they are already builtin in django. (Migrations framework, Authentication app, Templating language)


4. Web Application and Website

=> Good security services (authentication, permission, CORS, CSRF)
=> Used for the hard deadline porjects.
=> Robustness
=> Most of the features are already provided


7. There are two types of solutions that can be achieved from Django framework
=> Template based solution - Here we create SSR webapps
=> APIs Solution - Here we create APIs using Django; DRF


8. What do we learn in this class?
=> For most of the time we stick to template based solution
=> Final project (by instructor) is also done in template based solution
